## Story

Although there's no set goal in this game, your purpose is to raise a virtual pet called a Sukogatchi. You do this by feeding, playing, and cleaning it. You can also play simple games to get SukoPoints and you can buy special treats for your pet to eat! This game is meant to be stress-relieving but beware, if you do a bad job, your Sukogatchi might get mad and run away!

## Esthetic's

This is meant to be a cute game so the graphics will be cartoony and simple. Sound will also be similar, with a soundtrack looping in the background and maybe some food noises when your Sukogatchi eats. Depending on the mini-games, there may also be simple sound for that as well.

## Gameplay

You start off with a Sukogatchi (Will be randomized between 3 choices) and it will have a happiness, cleanliness and hunger bar. If either gets too low, your pet will run away and you will receive a game over. Most of the game will be point and click. However, some games may use the arrow keys.

### Hunger

There will be a button that you can click and feed your Sukogatchi. Free food will be something normal like a sandwich, pasta, or salad. However, you can also buy special food items with SukoPoints (which you earn in mini-games). These include items such as Cookies, Cake, and Ice Cream. Each item raises your Sukogatchi's hunger bar by a certain amount (standard foods will be the same regardless of item) with special foods restoring more and even increasing your Sukogatchi's happiness!

### Happiness

Unlike the hunger bar, you raise your Sukogatchi's happiness bar with mini-games. Every time you earn a score higher than 0, your pet's happiness rises by a set amount. In addition to that, you will be rewarded with SukoPoints depending on how you did. Keep in mind that playing mini-games lowers your Cleanliness bar. Playing around will get you dirty!

### Cleanliness

If your Sukogatchi gets dirty, you're going to have to clean it up. You do this by pressing a button and your pet will be washed and your Cleanliness bar will slowly increase.

## Closing 
This game is meant to be played by everyone of all ages so no tutorial is necessary. The game itself it should be obvious enough for the player to figure everything out themselves. There this no endgoal planned at the moment, but there may be one once your Sukogatchi reaches a certain happiness level or if you earn a specific amount of money.
